        “…I want to meet her…”  <br />
        A soft voice rose up from within and surprised me. I want to meet her.  <br /> 
        Hearing those words the librarian quickly snapped her fingers.  <br />
        “You are a lucky one. That is because the Halloween party is about to begin. Surely you shall meet the king herself as well.” <br /> 
        “Really?!”  <br />
        Despite getting excited, what is a Halloween party? Seeing my confused expression, the librarian chuckled.<br /><br />

        “A Halloween party, you see, is when a festival is held for the underworld’s queen pact.“  <br />
        “Underworld… wait, you mean the realm of the dead!?”  <br />
        Shivers crawl up my back. The underworld’s queen? Sounds terrifying by itself.  <br />
        “Now, now. As long as you keep to the rules, no harm will come to you.”  <br />
        “No way... and by rules…?”  <br />
        “The rules so that the Halloween party may be enjoyed to its fullest.“<br /><br />

        The librarian took a short breather and started explaining the party.  <br />
        “Initially the Halloween party was a festival to pay respects to the dead. However, the dead, upon seeing this, wanted to ‘join in and have fun too!’.” So then an agreement was made between our king and the underworld’s queen, and so it became that the queen invited the living for a grand party in her castle.”
        <br /><br />
        True enough, seeing a fun festival like that would make me want to join too.  <br />
        “Have you seen the royal castle?”  <br />
        “Yes I have, but…”  <br />
        “Sealed beneath the castle is a gate to the underworld.”  <br />
        Are you for real!? My jaw dropped, dumbfounded. I’ve discovered another side of the castle behind curtains.  <br />
        “Once every year, that gate is opened solely for the party. You then go through it with others to the underworld’s queen castle.” <br /> 
        “Is that so…?”  <br />
        To put it simply, it's one big crowded party that blurs the line between dead and living. I’m sure all kinds of people gather there. Sounds fun. But…  
        <br />
        “It is kind of scary after all…”<br />

        “Hehehe. I shall teach these three rules to your fearful self.”  <br />
        She put up three fingers, and lowered them one by one.<br /><br />

        “First, always carry candy with you. It is customary to trade candy in a Halloween party. It also serves as a greeting, and you may receive some unusual candy.”  <br />
        Unusual candy! Could it be candy that’s not found in the realm of the living but in that of the dead? Just imagining unknown flavors got me drooling……<br />
        <br />
        “Second, come dressed in disguise. This is so the dead and the living may not be differentiated, mainly for any problems to be prevented. You will see many interesting costumes every single time.”  <br />
        Now that is exciting. I wonder what I’ll be able to see.  <br />
        “Third, and this is the most important one. Listen very carefully.”  <br />
        “Yes!”<br />

        “To always return to our world before time is up.”<br />

        The air turns dead silent.  <br />
        “And… If I don’t come back…?”  <br />
        “Then you will be joining the underworld’s citizens as one of their own.”  <br />
        “That basically means…”  <br />
        “That day will be the anniversary of your death.”  <br />
        “NOOO!!”  <br />
        I instinctively screamed, shaking my head. All my hair stood on end. But the librarian’s storytelling is so immersive! To be swept by the fun of the festival, only to die carelessly? Spare me. And I only just arrived in this country too! The person in question trying to spook me cackled, holding her belly in laughter.  
        <br />
        “This is no laughing matter!”  <br />
        “I apologize, your reaction was too perfect.”  <br />
        Probably from laughing too much, the librarian lightly wiped her tears with her fingers.  <br />
        “As long as you follow the third rule, it should be fine. Moreover, the rules are so that the underworld’s citizens may not harm the living.”  
        <br />
        The librarian said, as I glared at her through half-lidded eyes.  <br />
        “Is that right…?”  <br />
        “It is indeed. If it was not, the festival could not be held properly, yes?”  <br />
        That is true. We did go off-topic slightly and I’m not quite satisfied, but I understand that by following the rules it’ll be safe.
        <br /><br />
        “Come, it is about to begin.”  <br />
        Lively music started to play from afar. Before I realized it, the day started to fade, and the windows that appeared photochromic were dyed a deep evening glow. My view suddenly got smaller, and I felt cloth fall to my head and shoulders. Is this a mantle with a hood?  
        <br />
        Combining both hood and collar, she then attached that Osmanthus badge.  <br />
        “Rule number two, come dressed in disguise. I shall bestow you this mantle.”  <br />
        The librarian laughed as she got up.  <br />
        “Th-thank you so much!”  <br />
        I got up in tandem. After noticing, she headed to the door leading outside.<br />

        “Now, go outside and head towards the castle. Never once take off your hood.”  <br />
        “Okay!”  <br />
        Seemingly satisfied with my answer, she opened one side of the door.<br />
        <br />
        “Thank you very much!”  <br />
        Beyond the open door, in just these few hours, bat and pumpkin decorations were put up. More than that, Sukonbu with their favorite attire lining up towards the castle en masse could be seen. Ghosts with a cloth, made-up zombies, vampires and witches, even mummies. Unable to sit still, I firmly grasped the hood and dashed from the library.
        <br /><br />
        Running as fast as I could to not be left behind, with the castle beyond the stairs in mind.
