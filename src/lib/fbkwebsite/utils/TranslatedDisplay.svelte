        “…I want to meet her…”  <br />
        A soft voice rose up from within and surprised me. I want to meet her.  <br /> 
        Hearing those words the librarian quickly snapped her fingers.  <br />
        “You are a lucky one. That is because the Halloween party is about to begin. Surely you shall meet the king herself as well.” <br /> 
        “Really?!”  <br />
        Despite getting excited, what is a Halloween party? Seeing my confused expression, the librarian chuckled.<br /><br />

        “A Halloween party, you see, is when a festival is held for the underworld’s queen pact.“  <br />
        “Underworld… wait, you mean the realm of the dead!?”  <br />
        Shivers crawl up my back. The underworld’s queen? Sounds terrifying by itself.  <br />
        “Now, now. As long as you keep to the rules, no harm will come to you.”  <br />
        “No way... and by rules…?”  <br />
        “The rules so that the Halloween party may be enjoyed to its fullest.“<br /><br />
